---------- income_agent ----------
It sounds like the project is well on track for completion. Let's make sure all the final steps are executed smoothly:

1. **Integration Testing:** Each component should be tested in the context of the whole system to ensure seamless navigation, consistent data flow, and proper interaction between different elements.

2. **Responsive Design Check:** Since ensuring a seamless experience across all device types is crucial, verify that all pages load properly and maintain usability on mobile, tablet, and desktop platforms.

3. **User Acceptance Testing (UAT):** Engage with a few target users to navigate through the website and gather their feedback. This is essential for identifying real-world usability issues.

4. **Back-End Validation:** Ensure the database interactions run efficiently and securely, validating that data captured is stored accurately and safely.

5. **Security Check:** Confirm that proper validation is implemented for all inputs to prevent security vulnerabilities like injection attacks.

6. **Cross-Browser Compatibility:** Make sure that all functionalities work across major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).

7. **Final Tweaks and Polishing:** After collating all the feedback and test results, make any necessary adjustments to improve overall performance and reliability.

Once the tasks above are satisfactorily completed, and each agent has confirmed their page is functioning properly, the project can be officially marked as complete. Inform the planner and the team once everything is validated to proceed with the launch. Congratulations on the progress so far!
