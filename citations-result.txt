Develop a comprehensive set of citations for a research paper exploring the impact of CRISPR-Cas9 on gene therapy. 1) The scientist agent should create a ranked plan for finding citations, focusing on foundational papers, recent advancements, and clinical trial data. 2) The researcher agent will execute the search and compile references from databases like PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science. 3) The critic agent will validate the citations for scientific rigor and alignment with the research goals. The final set of references should be organized by relevance and ready for inclusion in a publication. Each agent should signal task completion explicitly to terminate their part in the workflow.

**Comprehensive Plan for Identifying and Ranking Citations on CRISPR-Cas9 Gene Therapy**

**Step 1: Preparation and Database Selection**

1. **Objective Clarification**:
   - Define key themes and objectives: foundational understanding, recent advancements, and clinical applications of CRISPR-Cas9 in gene therapy.
   
2. **Database Selection**:
   - Identify relevant databases: PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science.
   - Note access requirements and permissions for each database.

**Step 2: Conducting the Search**

1. **Keyword Strategy Development**:

2. **Search Execution**:
   - Execute initial broad searches in each database to gain an overview.
   - Use Boolean operators and field-specific searches (e.g., title, abstract, keywords) to narrow results.

3. **Sorting by Relevance and Date**:
   - Sort by citations, number of references, and recent publications within the last 5 years to focus on recent advancements.

**Step 3: Identification of Core Publications**

1. **Foundational Papers**:
   - Identify seminal works that introduced and expanded on CRISPR-Cas9 technology (e.g., papers by Doudna and Charpentier).
   - Cross-reference citation counts and seminal reviews in the field.

2. **Recent Advancements**:
   - Look for studies showcasing advancements, improvements in the CRISPR-Cas9 mechanism, off-target effects, and new delivery methods.
   - Identify meta-analyses or systematic reviews from recent years highlighting technological progress.

3. **Clinical Trial Data**:
   - Search for documented clinical trials using CRISPR-Cas9 for gene therapy using databases such as ClinicalTrials.gov.
   - Prioritize trials with peer-reviewed results and significant developments.

**Step 4: Ranking and Compilation**

1. **Ranking Criteria**:
   - Relevance to the defined themes.
   - Citation frequency and scientific impact.
   - Recency and up-to-date findings.
   - Presence of rigorous experimental and clinical trial data.

2. **Compilation**:
   - Organize the selected citations into three sections: foundational papers, recent advancements, and clinical trial data.
   - Write a concise abstract for each section summarizing key trends and contributions.

**Step 5: Validation by Critic Agent**

1. **Scientific Rigor Validation**:
   - Cross-check selected papers for scientific validity, examining methodologies and reproducibility.
   - Review alignment with the research goals and the paper’s objectives.

2. **Final Review and Organization**:
   - Ensure all references are formatted correctly for the intended publication style.
   - Confirm that all key topics and notable studies in the field are included.

**Output**

- Produce a well-organized and annotated bibliography ready for integration into the research paper.
